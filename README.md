1. I would not use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application, because as the name implies, the message feature of a messaging app likely takes into consideration a bunch of other features/components, and we can't see how these multiple other components interact in this case
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging app because something like that is small in range/interacting components, making it great for testing quickly and efficiently.
